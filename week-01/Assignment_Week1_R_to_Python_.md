# Assignment -- R → Python Data Analysis Bridge (Week 1)

## Overview

This assignment focuses on translating core ideas from R into Python
using NumPy.\
You will practice predicting outputs, writing equivalent Python code,
and explaining conceptual differences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning Goals

-   Translate basic R code into Python
-   Distinguish Python lists from NumPy arrays
-   Apply vectorized operations correctly
-   Explain conceptual differences between R and Python

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part A -- Translation (Conceptual)

For the R code below:

1.  Predict the output\
2.  Translate it into Python\
3.  Compute the result in Python

``` r
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
y <- ifelse(x > 4, x^2, x + 1)
mean(y)
```

Clearly show your Python code and final result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part B -- Lists vs NumPy Arrays

1.  Create a Python list of numbers 1--5\
2.  Attempt to multiply the list by 2\
3.  Convert the list to a NumPy array and repeat the multiplication

Answer the following questions:

-   What happened in each case?\
-   Why does NumPy behave differently?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part C -- Short Reflection (3--4 sentences)

Explain one key conceptual difference between R and Python that stood
out to you in this assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Submission Instructions

-   Submit a completed Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file).
-   Make sure all code runs without errors.
-   Clearly label each section (Part A, Part B, Part C).
-   Include short written explanations where requested.
-   Organize your notebook neatly and professionally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Focus on understanding the ideas behind the translation --- not just
syntax.
